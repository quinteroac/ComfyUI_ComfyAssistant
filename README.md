# ComfyUI Assistant

An AI assistant for ComfyUI: control and explore your workflows with natural language from a chat in the bottom panel. The assistant lives in **Console** — open Console, then the **ComfyUI Assistant** tab to start chatting.

- Chat with an AI that understands ComfyUI and can add nodes, connect them, run workflows, and search your environment.
- Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (or Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI). Configure your provider in the Assistant tab.
- You can customize the assistant with user skills, personality, and goals; the extension also ships with base skills for workflows, tools, and research.
- **Personas** let you switch between named personalities tied to a provider: each persona is a `SOUL.md` in `user_context/personas/<slug>/` (name, description, provider in frontmatter). Use `/persona` to list, `/persona <name>` to switch, `/persona create` to add one, and `/persona del <name>` to remove.

📚 **Documentation:** [User docs](doc/README.md) (installation, configuration, commands, skills, tools) · [Developer docs](doc/dev_docs/README.md) (architecture, backend, frontend, standards).

## Quick Start

**[Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md)** — Get running in a few minutes.

Open **Console** in the bottom panel, then the **ComfyUI Assistant** tab, and try:

- Ask the assistant to load a workflow for any of the models supported by ComfyUI.
- Ask the assistant to create a txt2img workflow with detailer and upscaler.
- Chat about your workflow and ask for suggestions; you can ask the assistant to apply changes directly to the workflow.
- Ask the assistant to organize your workflow (layout and readability).
- Brainstorm prompts with the assistant and ask it to run the workflow with that prompt.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo into ComfyUI’s `custom_nodes` folder.
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -e .` (from the extension root).
3. Build the frontend: `cd ui && npm install && npm run build && cd ..`
4. Restart ComfyUI.

Full steps and options: [doc/installation.md](doc/installation.md). You can use an AI agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.) to run the install — see [Using an AI agent to install](doc/installation.md#using-an-ai-agent-to-install) in the install guide. For the agent’s context: [.agents/skills/installation/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/installation/SKILL.md).

## Usage

Open the **ComfyUI Assistant** tab, set up your LLM provider (wizard on first use or [doc/configuration.md](doc/configuration.md)), and chat. The assistant can modify the workflow, run it, search nodes and models, and use the web and the ComfyUI Registry when needed.

- **Commands:** Slash commands like `/help`, `/clear`, `/new`, `/skill`, `/persona` — see [doc/commands.md](doc/commands.md).
- **What the assistant can do:** Graph actions, environment search, user skills, workflow execution, research — see [doc/base-tools.md](doc/base-tools.md).
- **Customization:** System and user context, skills, SOUL, goals — see [doc/](doc/README.md).
- **Personas:** Named personalities per provider (`user_context/personas/<slug>/SOUL.md` with YAML frontmatter). `/persona` lists them, `/persona <name>` switches, `/persona create` adds one, `/persona del <name>` removes. See [doc/configuration.md](doc/configuration.md).
- You can **switch provider or persona in the middle of a conversation**; the assistant keeps the same thread and context, so the new provider or persona continues from the existing chat.

## Recommended providers

- **Claude Opus 4.6** — Best for complex tasks (workflow design, multi-step reasoning). More expensive; use the Anthropic API or Open Router.
- **Gemini** — Good for most day-to-day tasks. Use Gemini CLI or the Open Router API.
- **Grok** — Great for prompt ideas and creative brainstorming. Use the x.ai API or Open Router.

Results can vary depending on which model you choose. **Frontier models** (e.g. latest Claude Opus, GPT-4 class, or top-tier Open Router models) generally give better workflow quality and fewer errors; smaller or older models may need more back-and-forth or manual tweaks.

See [doc/configuration.md](doc/configuration.md) for how to add and switch providers.

## Development

Frontend: `cd ui && npm run watch` (rebuilds on change; refresh the browser). Tests: `cd ui && npm test`.  
Architecture, backend, frontend, tools, and conventions: [doc/dev_docs/](doc/dev_docs/README.md).
