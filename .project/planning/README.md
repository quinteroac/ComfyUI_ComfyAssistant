# Planning

This directory holds **planning and design documentation** for the project: ideas, implementation notes, roadmaps, and other material that does not map directly to shipped functionality or runnable code.

**Purpose**

- Capture ideas and design decisions before or alongside implementation
- Document implementation plans, alternatives considered, and trade-offs
- Keep a single place for "work in progress" or future work that is not yet in the main docs (e.g. `.agents/` or `README.md`)

**Audience**

- **Humans**: contributors and maintainers who want context on how and why things are planned
- **Agents**: AI assistants that need project context; see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and `.agents/` for conventions and where to look first

**Structure**

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [implemented/](implemented/) | Plans and design docs that have been fully implemented (kept for reference) |
| [on-hold/](on-hold/) | Plans deferred for later — not cancelled, but not in active work |
| [backlog/](backlog/) | Planning and design for work not yet done; candidates for implementation |
