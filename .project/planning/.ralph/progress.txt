## Codebase Patterns
- Keep user-context personality loading backward-compatible by resolving active persona first and falling back to legacy `user_context/SOUL.md`.
- Validate persona provider bindings against `providers.db` before injecting persona instructions into the system prompt.
- For backend local multi-turn chat flows, persist flow state in hidden assistant HTML comments and recover it from prior assistant messages on the next user turn.
- Backend-handled slash commands must be kept in sync with frontend slash plumbing (`ui/src/slash-commands/commands.ts` and `ui/src/hooks/useSlashCommands.ts`) or commands will be swallowed client-side.

- Implemented persona folder convention under `user_context/personas/<slug>/SOUL.md` with required frontmatter fields (Name, Description, Provider) and free-text body support.
- Added backend loading for active persona via `preferences.active_persona`, with slug validation, SOUL frontmatter parsing, provider existence validation, and legacy SOUL fallback.
- Updated prompt assembly to include active persona metadata and applied documentation updates for persona layout/conventions.
- Files changed:
  - `user_context_store.py`
  - `user_context_loader.py`
  - `agent_prompts.py`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `user_context/README.md`
  - `user_context/personas/README.md`
  - `doc/configuration.md`
  - `doc/dev_docs/context-and-environment.md`
  - `.agents/project-context.md`
  - `.agents/skills/system-and-user-context/SKILL.md`
  - `.project/planning/.ralph/prd.json`
  - `.project/planning/.ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep persona metadata parsing strict (required frontmatter + body) so later slash commands can rely on consistent files.
  - `.agents/` docs may require direct shell writes when patch tooling blocks hidden-path edits.
  - Repository-wide frontend lint currently has unrelated baseline issues; story-scoped Python checks passed.

- Implemented a local conversational persona-creation flow triggered by `/persona create` (and plain `create persona` variants), with deterministic multi-turn prompts for name, personality description, and provider selection.
- Added provider-aware persona file creation that writes `user_context/personas/<slug>/SOUL.md` with required YAML frontmatter (`Name`, `Description`, `Provider`) plus body text from the personality description.
- Wired persona creation into chat routing before provider dispatch so the flow runs even when no LLM credentials are available.
- Updated agent documentation to capture the new slash-command capability and local flow-state pattern.
- Files changed
  - `slash_commands.py`
  - `__init__.py`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.agents/project-context.md`
  - `.agents/skills/backend-architecture/SKILL.md`
  - `.project/planning/.ralph/prd.json`
  - `.project/planning/.ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: local conversational command flows can be implemented safely by encoding compact JSON state in hidden assistant comments and parsing the latest assistant marker each turn.
  - Gotchas encountered: `user_context_store.set_user_context_path(...)` must be set before provider-store operations in standalone scripts/tests.
  - Useful context: routing local persona flow before provider credential checks guarantees the creation wizard remains available offline.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented backend `/persona <name>` switching in `slash_commands.py`: resolves persona by slug or frontmatter name, validates persona/provider configuration, sets `preferences.active_persona`, activates the persona's provider, and reloads runtime provider config.
- Preserved existing local multi-turn `/persona create` flow while unifying persona handling through a single backend handler path in chat routing.
- Updated frontend slash command registry and backend-forwarding allowlist so `/persona` is sent to backend (with autocomplete/help support) instead of being consumed as unknown local command.
- Synced agent/project docs with the new slash capability and added reusable command-sync guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
- Files changed
  - `slash_commands.py`
  - `__init__.py`
  - `ui/src/hooks/useSlashCommands.ts`
  - `ui/src/slash-commands/commands.ts`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.agents/project-context.md`
  - `.agents/skills/backend-architecture/SKILL.md`
  - `.project/planning/.ralph/prd.json`
  - `.project/planning/.ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: backend slash commands require matching frontend command declaration plus forwarding allowlist to ensure chat submit sends the command upstream.
  - Gotchas encountered: full-repo frontend lint is currently red due unrelated baseline formatting/parsing issues; use targeted lint on touched files to validate story changes.
  - Useful context: automated browser verification via the requested `dev-browser` skill is currently unavailable in this environment, so verification was done with backend functional checks and frontend command-path validation.
