# .project

This folder groups **planning** and **development** documentation, separate from application code and from agent-facing docs (`.agents/`).

**Contents**

- **[planning/](planning/)** — Planning and design: ideas, roadmaps, specs, WIP. See [planning/README.md](planning/README.md).
- **[development/](development/)** — Phase implementation records (e.g. `phase_1/implemented.md`, `phase_8/implemented.md`).

**Conventions**

- See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [.agents/](../.agents/) for how agents and contributors use this repo and where to look first.
